/**
 * This class implements a run length encoded index of pointers, pointing to variable length
 * blocks. Pointers have to be sorted by ascending block sizes. This reduces the compression
 * problem to compressing a sorted array of integer values. The compression rate is just a
 * constant factor but since the ram is very sparse on smart phones, this saves relatively much
 * of ram. It is traded off with runtime, on the one hand caused by the required shift
 * operations, on the other hand a constant amount of pointers has to be read, to access a
 * single pointer entry. The overhead is constant an can be limited by group size. Additionally
 * a method is provided which determines the optimal group size with regard to a given
 * threshold. On Average (group size) / 2 entries are read per lookup assuming uniform
 * distribution of lookups.
